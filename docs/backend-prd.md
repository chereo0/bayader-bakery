## 6. Authentication & Authorization
- Use JWT access tokens (short lived) + refresh tokens stored securely (httpOnly cookie or DB) for session management.
- Passwords: hashed with Argon2 (preferred) or bcrypt with a high work factor.
- Role-based access control (RBAC): middleware to check staff/admin privileges for protected routes.
- Admin portal requires 2FA for critical actions (optional, recommended).

## 7. Payments & Billing
- Implement a Payment Adapter pattern to support multiple gateways.
- All payment interactions should be PCI-compliant (do not store sensitive card details). Use gateway tokens.
- Provide a webhook handler that validates gateway signatures and updates payment/order status idempotently.

## 8. Inventory Handling
- Decrement stock only when payment succeeds (or on order confirmation for cash on delivery, based on business rules).
- Use DB transactions to update order and inventory atomically.
- Provide optimistic locking on Product stock to avoid oversell (version number or SELECT ... FOR UPDATE).
- Generate low-stock alerts via background job and send notifications to admin.

## 9. Notifications & Messaging
- Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) or background worker (e.g., BullMQ) for asynchronous tasks: send emails/SMS, generate reports, update analytics.
- Worker responsibilities: process payments webhooks, send notifications, resize/store uploaded images, generate daily reports.

## 10. Delivery Management
- Data model: Driver (id, name, phone, vehicle), DeliveryAssignment (order_id, driver_id, status, ETA)
- Admin endpoints to assign/unassign drivers and to update delivery status.
- Optionally expose a driver mobile API to update location and status; aggregate location updates for real-time tracking (via WebSocket).

## 11. Admin Dashboard & Analytics
- Backend exposes aggregated endpoints for dashboards (sales per day/week/month, top products, active customers).
- Use cron jobs or event-driven rollups to maintain materialized views for fast queries.

## 12. File Storage & Images
- Store uploaded images in object storage (AWS S3 or compatible). Generate signed URLs for client access.
- Thumbnails & optimized images should be generated by background workers and stored alongside originals.

## 13. Infrastructure & Deployment
- Containerized services (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) or serverless (ECS/Fargate) depending on scale.
- Environments: dev, staging, production. CI/CD pipeline for automated tests and deployments.
- Use managed Postgres (RDS/Aurora) and Redis (Elasticache) when possible.

## 14. Security & Compliance
- HTTPS everywhere. HSTS. Secure cookies.
- Input validation, rate limiting, request throttling for public endpoints.
- OWASP best practices, helmet headers, sanitization.
- Audit logging for admin actions.
- Data retention and deletion policy; PII handling and privacy compliance (GDPR/local laws).

## 15. Monitoring & Observability
- Application metrics (Prometheus) and logs (ELK or managed service). Alerting for errors, high latency, and low stock.
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger/X-Ray) for request flows.

## 16. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for services and adapters.
- Integration tests for APIs with test DB.
- End-to-end tests for critical flows (registration, ordering, payments).
- Security tests and periodic penetration testing.

## 17. Backup & Disaster Recovery
- Regular DB backups (daily), point-in-time recovery enabled.
- Test restoration procedures quarterly.

## 18. Non-Functional Requirements (backend-specific)
- Performance: Handle 100 concurrent users; scale horizontally using stateless services behind load balancers.
- Latency: API responses < 200ms for core endpoints under normal load.
- Availability: 99.9% uptime target for critical services.
- Scalability: Auto-scaling based on CPU, queue length, or latency.
- Maintainability: Modular codebase, clear separation, and documented APIs.

## 19. API Security & Rate Limiting
- API keys for partners/third-party integrations.
- Rate limits per IP and per API key; separate tiers for public vs authenticated endpoints.

## 20. Data Privacy
- Encrypt sensitive fields at rest when required.
- Provide endpoints to export or delete user data per regulations.

## 21. DevOps & CI/CD
- Automated builds, tests, linting on PRs.
- Canary or blue/green deployments for production updates.
- Rollback procedures and health checks.

## 22. Acceptance Criteria
- All listed endpoints implemented with tests.
- Authentication flows: register/login/refresh/logout working for all roles.
- Order lifecycle implemented with correct inventory and payment flow.
- Notifications sent on key events.
- Admin analytics endpoints return accurate aggregates.
- Backup and recovery procedures documented and tested.

## 23. Appendix: Integration Points
- Payment Gateways (Stripe, PayPal, local)
- SMS/Email (Twilio, SendGrid, SES)
- Object Storage (S3)
- Analytics/Monitoring services
