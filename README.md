Instructions to run locally:

1. Install dependencies

2. Start dev server

Notes:
- This project includes Tailwind configuration with the bakery color tokens.

- The UI uses small Magic-UI-like wrappers implemented in `src/components/ui`.

To quickly populate sample images for the homepage, run the helper PowerShell script:

From project root (PowerShell):
